# Password Generator

## Description
This application generates a password based on criteria that the user provides. The password has to be between 8 and 128 characters. The user can choose the password length, and what character types to include.

The starter code was cloned from Xandromus, https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/friendly-parakeet. 

I wrote the code in script.js, excluding the writePassword function.
